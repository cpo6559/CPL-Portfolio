            <p>
                Hi y'all! I'm Cami from Miami. I’m not from Miami proper, but Cami from South Florida doesn’t sound as

                good *shrugs*.

                I am a 22 year-old recent college graduate from Rice University who majored in Managerial Studies and
                Political Science. I come from a low income background and had the goal of graduating from college
                debt-free.

                My savings journey took me way beyond my initial goal.

                I saved at least $10,000 per year in my three and a half years of university. And I was even able to buy
                an investment property right out of college.

                This didn’t happen without lots of trial and error. I self-taught myself how to acquire, grow, and
                invest money while working a 45 hour work-week and taking a full “Ivy-league level” course-load. And now
                I want to help other people like me, with limited to no access to finance education, surpass their own
                financial goals and achieve the BIG goal: financial freedom. If I can do it with no car, in a new city,
                in the midst of a pandemic, anyone can do it.

                For these reasons and many more, I have created my first personal finance guide: The $10K Challenge. A
                relatable personal finance guide made by a Black woman for Black girls, women, femmes, and non-binary
                people navigating college and new adulthood.

                I want to make saving your first $10,000 or your next $10,000 as fun and impactful as possible. I also
                do the work right alongside you so you never feel alone at any point in your saving journey.

                My team and I have also established spaces on social media (@the10kcrew) to provide that community
                support we all so need.
